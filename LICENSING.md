### logos/Official Logos (No Text)/
All imags were pulled from above, the only difference being that is there was any text not needed from the logo (as in, the name of the distrobution itself), it was removed. This includes:
- Arch Lnux
- Endeavour OS
- NixOS
- OpenSUSE
- ReactOS
- Void

### logos/Edited Logos/
From here, the logos were edited more to fit a more common theme. Not much was changed from the **Official Logos (No Text)** folder to the **colors** folder, except for a few changes to a more flat color scheme (such as the Gentoo Logo having rid of it's gradients and the ReactOS Logo having rid of it's "shines").
In the **monochrome** folder, the only thing that was changed from the **colors** folder was the actual colors themselves (including transprency) to black, "Discord Gray" (see README.md), and white. 

##

### templates/
So far, the only template in there is **pride.svg**, which was created by hand, but was heavily inspired by the current Arch Linux Discord icon (shoutout to ziv#2481).

### pride/
These used the **logos/Edited Logos/monochrome/gray/** assets, as well as the **templates/pride.svg** asset in combination to make the icons.

### matte
These used the **logos/Edited Logos/monochrome/gray/** assets, and the backgrounds were picked from the color(s) from the **logos/Official Logos (*)**  assets.
